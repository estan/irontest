IronTest
========

IronTest is a test case management application for manual test cases.
It was created as part of the course *DD1361 Internet Programming* at KTH.

It consists of a Ruby on Rails application for desktop clients and an
Android app for mobile clients . The Android app speaks to the same database
as the desktop client using an XML API.

Here's a couple of screenshots of the two interfaces.
